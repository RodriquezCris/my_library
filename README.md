Hellos, in the pages I am trying to make a bookstore with my favorite books so that everyone can review it and put it on the list to read this year or for someone who loves to read but doesn't know how or with which book to start. This year I started to read mangas, and I have a good recommendation to start reading manga(Japan), manhwa (Korean), and Manhua(China).
